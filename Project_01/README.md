## Project Overview
This project is an extension of a thesis that investigated student dropout rates in rural higher education institutions in Colombia. The original work was significantly enhanced by incorporating advanced data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning, text analysis, and social network analysis.

## Problem Statement
Student dropout is a significant issue in higher education institutions, particularly in rural areas. This project aims to understand the factors contributing to student dropout and predict which students are at risk.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify students at risk of dropping out based on various factors such as academic performance, attendance, engagement levels, socioeconomic factors, personal factors, and social network characteristics.

## Methodology
The project uses a variety of data science techniques and machine learning algorithms. The data was first analyzed using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis. Then, several machine learning algorithms were applied, including supervised learning algorithms (such as SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks) and unsupervised learning algorithms (such as K-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN). The models were evaluated using various performance metrics, and the best model was selected based on these metrics.

## Results
The project successfully developed a predictive model that can identify students at risk of dropping out. The model can be used to generate early alerts for academic advisors or administrators, allowing for timely intervention.

## Future Work
Future work on this project could include refining the predictive model, incorporating more data, and developing a user-friendly interface for the model. Additionally, the model could be extended to predict other student outcomes.
